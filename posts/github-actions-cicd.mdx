During a recent mini-project ([audius enhanced](http://audiusenhanced.com)) I decided to implement a very simple CI/CD pipeline that deploys to a target
Digital Ocean droplet.

The only problem was I needed to include a .env in the docker image, but not in the repository.

### The Issue

Below is a sample build pipeline that you would see in GitHub Actions. It takes the most recent commit, builds a docker image, and uploads
it to the Dockerhub image repository.

```yaml
# [main.yml]
build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      -
        name: Set up QEMU
        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v1
        
      -
        name: Set up Docker buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
      
      -
        name: Login
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
        
      -
        name: Build and push
        id: docker_build
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.REPO_NAME }}
```

The only problem is this build will not include any files not present in your most recent GitHub commit. This means any `.env` files ignored by 
a `.gitignore` will not be present and result in your application crashing / throwing errors.

### The Solution

Including a `.env` in the build is actually really simple.

The basic concept is you create a secret with some arbitrary key (here I use `DOT_ENV`) and the value as your literal `.env` file. Then, before you build your docker image
you copy the secret into a new `.env` file using  
  
```sh
echo {DOT_ENV file here} > .env
```

Below is the modified code, which injects the `.env` into your docker build.

```yaml
# [main.yml]
build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
        -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
        -
        name: Add .env from secrets
        run: 'echo "$DOTENV" > .env'
        shell: bash
        env:
            DOTENV: ${{ secrets.DOT_ENV }}
        
        -
        name: Set up QEMU
        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v1
        
        -
        name: Set up Docker buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
        
        -
        name: Login
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
            username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
        
        -
        name: Build and push
        id: docker_build
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
            context: .
            push: true
            tags: ${{ secrets.REPO_NAME }}
```

Some important things to note is the addition of the **Checkout** step and the inclusion of **Context** as an argument in the last step.

If not added, the default implementation of `docker/build-push-action@v2` will ignore anything not present in the original GitHub commit,
including our recently created `.env`.
