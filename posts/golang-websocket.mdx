As of late I've been working on **Tyrnyr**, a math competition website that I'm making with some buddies. We want to add live game functionality, but we also
don't want to use Socket.io. Having been freed of school responsibilities in my senior year, I decided that I would throw time to the wind and write a library
in Go.

## Why not use Socket.io? (And frameworks in general)

Frameworks and other prebuilt solutions are great when you have no time, or will to build your own solution.

I've been using frameworks for web development, backend, and everything in between. It has made me good at getting things done, but it has kept my understanding
at a lower level than i'd like.
