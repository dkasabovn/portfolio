For my friends and others who ask me how to start with programming,

Programming is hard. People make it seem easy, but its just because they're big nerds and have spent a lot of time doing it.

As a rule of thumb, you should spend as much time programming as an average league player spends playing league. For those of you who don't get that,
it roughly translates to 2+ hours / day.

### How I Started

I recommend starting by learning frontend programming. But even before that you should learn JavaScript.

JavaScript can literally be used anywhere; Backend, frontend, and even machine learning can be entirely written
with the power of Node.js and its trusty friend NPM.

[Here's a good way to start](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

Once you have done that, you should at least get the gist of JavaScript. Feel free to try other languages if you're interested.
Otherwise go next.

### Off to Frameworks

Once you've got JavaScript down you're ready to start building something that can actually be enjoyable: A frontend.

I recommend learning Vue.js for frontend development. Vue.js is what is called a framework. It uses JavaScript, but for the most part,
is its own pseudo-language.

Learning Vue.js will take a while, and becoming good at Vue.js, is very difficult, but when you're done, you should theoretically be able to make
any website that you want. There are a multitude of ways to learn Vue.js and I recommend just googling how to do so, but a catch-all solution to anything
is to just go through [freeCodeCamp.org's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXpIoQ_rT_c&t=12534s) on youtube.

*After you watch the course you don't **know** Vue.js.*

You'll need to make projects to get a complete understanding.

Some good things to try:
- Make a tic tac toe game
- Make a chat app with firebase (google this one)
- Make a stock / crypto price visualizer

If you can successfully make all 3 of the above, I don't think it'd be a far fetch to say that you know what you're doing.

### The useful stuff

Now it's time to learn some actual concepts that you will be using if you ever work for a software company: Application design and architecture.

Application architecture is the broader understanding of how you would put an application together. This is where technical jargon such as API's, Microservices,
and Databases come in.

If you have a solid understanding of application architecture you should be able to use an application, then be able to draw the app's architecture on a whiteboard.
It's about knowing what tools are available for application building and is the CS equivalent of a vocab quiz in english class.

It's not particularily fun to study but once you learn it, a lot of things start making sense.

#### How do I learn it?

There _is_ no one way to learn application design. The way I learned it is by taking my AWS certificates and googling everything that I didn't understand until it made sense.

*Once again freeCodeCamp.org is a great resource for AWS certificates*

If you want to learn via AWS Certificates, be ready to not understand most things. In these lessons they will randomly say something like 'setup a subnet within this CIDR range'
and unless you took a course on networking, you will have to google literally everything to figure out what the F%@* they just said.

Luckily google's a large place and there are a lot of nerds out there willing to answer your question (so long as its not a duplicate on Stackoverflow).

### Ok I did everything above what do I do now?

If you've done everything above its time to start practicing. By now you should know JavaScript, how to build a frontend, and the basics of writing an app.

From here its all about googling how to do something.

If you don't know what to do, here are some projects I think are fun:
- Write a stock trading bot using alpaca with a frontend to track your profit
- Write a clone of chess.com
- Do whatever you want!

### General advice

This article by no means is exhaustive. I think that the best way to describe the above it to say that it gives you knowledge of your options.

There are so many things still to learn such as `git`, `containerization`, `devops`, and `databases`. These things you should learn on your own.

I hesitate to tell people to watch a tutorial to 'learn how to code' because that isn't how you should be learning. The best way, in my experience,
is to jump right into it.

Anyways, good luck. If you're reading this I've probably referred you to this, so feel free to reach out for help.
